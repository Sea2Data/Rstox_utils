# Rstox_utils
Repository for code used in relation to (but not included in) the Rstox R-package

This repository contains code and scripts used in relations to or in the development of the Rstox package. 
The Sead2Data/Rstox repository is a full R package, and is not well suited for holding development code and ideas 
which may at some point be included in the Rstox package. 
Automated test code for testing new versions of Rstox is contained in this repository (TestRstox.R), as well as code for building Rstox (build.R).
